<h2>Forum</h2>

<p>All questions about using Cadabra can be posted on
  the <a href="http://cadabra.science/qa">Cadabra Q&amp;A</a> forum. The forum accepts LaTeX
  formulas and is fully searchable.

<p>The old mailing list has been closed as it does not offer as much
  functionality as the new forum.</p>

	of the input language, the algorithms and technical details on how
