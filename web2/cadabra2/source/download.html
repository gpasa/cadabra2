<h1>Download and install</h1>

<h2>Linux</h2>
<p>
  Packages for various Linux distributions are available for download
  here. They get updated on a semi-regular basis by yours truly.  
</p>
<p>
  Note that if your distribution has a <code>cadabra</code> package, this
  will contain a 1.x version, which is no longer being updated. The
  packages available here will eventually make it into the
  distributions as well, under the name <code>cadabra2</code>, but that
  may take a while. You can install versions 1.x and 2.x in parallel,
  they will not interfere with each other.
</p>

<p>
  (In case you wonder:  in the package number <code>2.0.bbb.ggggggg</code>
  the <code>bbb</code> is the build number and
  the <code>ggggggg</code> the git SHA hash of the version that this
  package contains.)
</p>

<p>
  Is your distribution not listed above? Either build Cadabra from
  source (see below) or send an email
  to <a href="mailto:info@cadabra.science">info@cadabra.science</a>
  to request a package for your distribution.
</p>

<!--<p>
  If you are on an Ubuntu/Mint/Debian system, you can install a recent
  version of Cadabra by enabling the PPA,
</p>
  <div class="literal">
	 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kasper-peeters/ppa<br/>
	 sudo apt-get update<br/>
	 sudo apt-get install cadabra2
  </div>
<p>
  You can then start the notebook interface with 
</p>
  <div class="literal">
	 cadabra-gtk
  </div>
<p>
  or pick it from the 'Education' menu.
</p> -->

<h2>OS X</h2>
<p>
  For the time being you will need to compile from source to install
  on OS X.
</p>


<h2>Build from source (Linux or OS X)</h2>
<p>
  Alternatively, you can compile Cadabra from source yourself (not difficult). The source
  is distributed via github, see the
   <a href="https://github.com/kpeeters/cadabra2">kpeeters/cadabra2</a>
  repository for more details, including the pre-requisites.
</p>
<p>
  You can build .deb and .rpm packages yourself when building from
  source, by running <code>sudo cpack</code> after a successful
  build. Note that on rpm systems this requires the use
  of <code>cmake3</code> and <code>cpack3</code>; the default cmake will lead to a broken package.
