<h1>Jupyter/IPython compatibility</h1>
<p>
  The design goal for Cadabra version 2 is to make the notebook
  interface read and display Jupyter/IPython compliant notebooks. The
  kernel will also be able to execute them if they contain only cells
  with Python code.  For the time being only a (very) limited subset
  of notebooks actually work, but the architecture is there.
