Cadabra is a computer algebra system designed specifically for the
solution of problems encountered in field theory. It has extensive
functionality for tensor polynomial simplification including
multi-term symmetries, fermions and anti-commuting variables,
Clifford algebras and Fierz transformations, implicit coordinate
dependence, multiple index types and many more. The input format is
a subset of TeX. This is the 2.x series of the software.
