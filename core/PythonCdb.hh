/// Property is a templated wrapper around a C++ property object. It
/// provides it with _latex, __str__ and __repr__ methods. In order to
/// have a quick way to figure out in Python whether an object is a
/// property, we derive it from BaseProperty, which is an empty
/// placeholder (in Python BaseProperty is called Property).
///
/// Properties can have arguments. These are not parsed by Python, but
/// rather by the C++ side. There is a number of reasons for doing
/// things this way. The most important of them is that this makes it
/// a lot easier for Cadabra to provide useful feedback on parameters
/// which are not valid. So all properties get initialised with two
/// Cadabra Ex objects: the 1st is the pattern to which the property
/// should be attached, the 2nd is the argument of the property,
/// interpreted as a Cadabra expression.
///
/// Cadabra properties cannot be proper Python properties, because we
/// need to give the latter names in order to prevent them from going
/// out of scope. So Cadabra keeps a list of 'anonymous property objects 
/// in the current scope'. 
///
/// The question is now what we do when Python keeps a pointer to these
/// objects, and let that pointer escape local scope (e.g. by returning
/// the Python property object). How do we keep it in scope?

/// Setup of kernels in current scope, callable from Python.
/// When the decision was made to graft Cadabra onto Python, a choice had
/// to be made about how Python variable scope would influence the
/// visibility of Cadabra properties. It clearly makes sense to be able to
/// declare properties which only hold inside a particular
/// function. However Cadabra expressions and properties do not directly
/// correspond to Python objects. Rather, declaring a property is more
/// like a function call into the Cadabra module, which leaves its imprint
/// on the state of the C++ part but does not change anything on the
/// Python side, as you typically do not assign the created property to a
/// Python symbol. Therefore, properties do not naturally inherit Python's
/// scoping rules.\footnote{This is different from e.g.~SymPy, in which
///   mathematical objects are always in one-to-one correspondence with a
///   Python object.} A more fundamental problem is that properties can be
/// attached to patterns, and those patterns can involve more than just
/// the symbols which one passes into a function.
/// 
/// In order to not burden the user, properties are therefore by default
/// global variables, stored in a single global Cadabra object
/// \verb|__cdbkernel__| which is initialised at import of the Cadabra module. 
/// If you add new properties inside a function scope, these will go
/// into this already existing \emph{global} property list by default.
/// If you want to create a local scope for your computations, create a
/// new \verb|__cdbkernel__| as in
/// \begin{verbatim}
/// def fun():
///    __cdbkernel__ = cadabra.create_scope();
///    [your code here]
/// \end{verbatim}
/// Now computations will not see the global properties at all. 
/// If you want to import the global properties, use instead
/// \begin{verbatim}
/// def fun():
///    __cdbkernel__ = cadabra.create_scope_from_global()
///    [your code here]
/// \end{verbatim}
/// It is crucial that the
/// \verb|__cdbkernel__| symbol is referenced from within Python and visible to the bytecompiler, because 
/// it is not possible to create new variables on the local stack at runtime.
/// Internally, the second version above fetches, at runtime, the
/// \verb|__cdbkernel__| from the globals stack, copies all properties in there
/// into a new kernel, and returns the latter. 
/// 
/// Both versions above do populate the newly created kernel with
/// Cadabra's default properties. If you want a completely clean slate
/// (for e.g.~testing purposes, or because you really do not want default
/// rules for sums and products), use
/// \begin{verbatim}
/// def fun():
///    __cdbkernel__ = cadabra.create_empty_scope()
///    [your code here]
/// \end{verbatim}
/// Note that in all these cases, changes to properties remain local and
/// do not leak into the global property list.
/// 
/// All Cadabra algorithms, when called from Python, will first look for a
/// kernel on the locals stack (i.e.~what \verb|locals()| produces). If
/// there is no kernel available locally, they will then revert to using
/// the global kernel.
