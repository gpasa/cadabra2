\cdbalgorithm{einsteinify}{}

In an expression containing dummy indices at the same position
(i.e.~either both subscripts or both superscripts), raise one of the
indices.
\begin{screen}{1,2}
ex:= A_{m} A_{m};
einsteinify(_);
A^{m} A_{m};
\end{screen}
If an additional argument is given to this command, it instead inserts
``inverse metric'' objects, with the name as indicated by the
additional argument.
\begin{screen}{1,2}
{m,n}::Indices.
A_{m} A_{m};
@einsteinify!(%){\eta};
A_{m} A_{n} \eta^{m n};
\end{screen}
Note that the second form requires that there are enough dummy indices
defined through the use of \subsprop{Indices}.
